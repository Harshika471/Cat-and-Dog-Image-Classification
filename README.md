# Cat-and-Dog-Image-Classification
Task Definition
Our basic task is to create an algorithm to classify whether an image contains a dog or a cat. The input for this task is images of dogs or cats from training dataset, 
while the output is the classification accuracy on test dataset. The dataset comprised 1000 training images and 100 test images.

Overview
The image processing is a very common topic of research. It is known that the syatem defines an Image in the form an array of pixels and the size can be defined as 300 * 300*3 
where 300 is width 300 is height and 3 is RGB channel values.The difference of how human seeing an image and how computer is refer as semantic gap.In this problem, we train 
the classifier and classifier has to recognize an image based on its label.
